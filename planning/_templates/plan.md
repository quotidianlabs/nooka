**Goal:** One sentence — what shipping this plan achieves. No design
rationale; link to the spec for that.

**Spec:** [`design.md`](./design.md)

**Branch:** `feat/my-change` (or `fix/`, `chore/`, etc.)

**Commit strategy:** Per-task commits / single commit / squash on merge.
Whichever fits.

### Task 1: <imperative description>

**Files:**
- Modify: `path/to/file.dart`
- Create: `path/to/new.dart`

One sentence on what this task accomplishes. No deeper reasoning — that's
in the spec.

- [ ] **Step 1: <action>**

  Run / edit / verify command. Expected output.

- [ ] **Step 2: <action>**

  ...

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

  ```bash
  git add path/to/file.dart
  git commit -m "<type>: <subject>
